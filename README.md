## About
The [tyk-k8s-demo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo) library allows you to stand up an entire Tyk Stack
with all its dependencies as well as other tools that can integrate with Tyk.
The library will spin up everything in Kubernetes using `helm` and bash magic
to get you started.

## Purpose
Minimize the amount of effort needed to stand up the Tyk infrastructure and
show examples of how Tyk can be setup in k8s using different deployment
architectures as well as different integrations.

## Getting started

#### Requirements
You will need the following tools to be able to run this library.
- [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) (only when using `--cloud` flag)

Tested on Linux/Unix based systems on AMD64 and ARM architectures

#### Initial setup
Create `.env` file and update the appropriate fields with your licenses.
If you require a trial license, you can obtain one [here](https://tyk.io/sign-up/).
If you are looking to use the `tyk-gateway` deployment only you will
not require any licensing as that is the open-source deployment.

```
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo.git
cd tyk-k8s-demo
cp .env.example .env
```

Depending on the deployments you would like install set values of the
`LICENSE`, `MDCB_LICENSE` and `PORTAL_LICENSE` inside the `.env` file.

### Minikube
If you are deploying this on Minikube, you will need to enable the ingress
addon. You do so by running the following:
```
minikube start
minikube addons enable ingress
```

## Quick Start

```
./up.sh --deployments portal,operator-httpbin tyk-stack
```
This quick start command will stand up the entire Tyk stack along with the
Tyk Enterprise Portal and the Tyk Operator and httpbin CRD example.

## Possible deployments
- `tyk-stack`: Tyk single region self-managed deployment
- `tyk-cp`: Tyk self-managed multi region control plane (Will be available in Q1 2024 on v3, use the v2 branch if you would like to deploy this.)
- `tyk-dp`: Tyk self-managed data plane, this can connect to Tyk Cloud or a Tyk Control Plane
- `tyk-gateway`: Tyk oss self-managed single region

## Dependencies Options
### Redis Options
- `redis`: Bitnami Redis deployment
- `redis-cluster`: Bitnami Redis Cluster deployment
- `redis-sentinel`: Bitnami Redis Sentinel deployment

### Storage Options
- `mongo`: Bitnami Mongo database deployment as a Tyk backend
- `postgres`: Bitnami Postgres database deployment as a Tyk backend

If you are running a POC and would like an example of how to integrate a
specific tool. Please submit a request through the repository [here](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s-demo/issues).

### Example
```
./up.sh \
  --storage postgres \
  --deployments prometheus-grafana,k6-slo-traffic \
  tyk-stack
```

The deployment will take 10 minutes as the installation is sequential and the
dependencies require a bit of time before they are stood up. Once the
installation is complete, the script will print out a list of all the services
that were stood up and how those can be accessed. The k6 job will start running
after the script is finished and will run in the background for 15 minutes to
generate traffic over that period of time. To visualize the live traffic, you
can use the credentials provided by the script to access Grafana or the Tyk
Dashboard.

## Usage

  -f, --flavor          enum     k8s environment flavor. This option can be set 'openshift' and defaults to 'vanilla'
  -e, --expose          enum     set this option to 'port-forward' to expose the services as port-forwards or to 'load-balancer' to expose the services as load balancers or 'ingress' which exposes services as a k8s ingress object
